**新年快乐 · Building with purpose**

AI Research, Strategy, and Social Design

---

This portfolio documents my work building agentic AI systems, systems that don't just respond but plan, decide, and act. I'm particularly interested in healthcare applications (real-time risk monitoring through EHRs and wearables) and education (adaptive tutoring that meets students where they are).

The journal format exists because I wanted to show the thinking behind the building. How research on human psychology informs the way I design AI agents. What I actually made, the choices I made, and why. Everything here traces back to real projects and verifiable sources.

## Why Red and Gold?

This journal wears the colors of 春节 (Chinese Lunar New Year). Red for luck, gold for prosperity.

My family came to America with very little. They worked long hours so I could have chances they didn't. These colors remind me where I come from and what I'm working toward. Being first-gen Chinese American means carrying two worlds.

以人为本 (people first) is how I try to build.

## The Path Here

Girls Who Code gave me the technical foundation. The Hudson and Holland Scholars program brought me to Indiana University on a full ride. Direct admission to Luddy let me dive straight into the work.

**What I focus on:**

Agentic AI systems that automate workflows. Real-time data processing. Autonomous decision-making within clear boundaries. Human oversight and transparent operations.

## Experience

### Undergraduate Research Assistant

**Indiana University Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering**
May 2024 through December 2025

Healthcare AI Systems

Built a database system that pulls patient data from three sources (EHRs, wearables, lab results) and flags anomalies automatically. The system routes alerts to clinical staff when something looks off. We saw a 30% drop in data entry errors and staff reported spending 25 to 40% less time on data tasks. Everything stayed HIPAA-compliant.

### AI Client Team Lead

**Laurie Burns McRobbie Serve IT Clinic, Luddy School, Indiana University**
January 2024 through December 2025

Educational AI Systems

Led a team of 4 to build a tutoring system that adjusts difficulty based on how students are doing. It plugs into Canvas and Blackboard, tracks performance, and gives teachers a dashboard to override anything. Engagement went up 35% and teachers saved 8 to 12 hours a week on grading. We built in audit trails so you can see exactly what the system decided and why.

### Web Designer

**Girls Who Code**
May 2019 through December 2024

Nonprofit Technology

Built websites for nonprofits that track visitor behavior and change content based on what people seem interested in. Bounce rates dropped 28%, engagement went up 42%. Also built email systems that A/B test campaigns automatically. Donation conversions went up 22% and marketing staff spent half as much time on manual work.

## Research Foundation

I'm including this section because I think it matters to show where ideas come from. The frameworks I use to design AI systems didn't appear out of nowhere. They're grounded in decades of research on how people think, decide, and interact with technology.

38 peer-reviewed sources across 9 disciplines, including work from 3 Nobel Prize winners spanning 70 years of research. Prospect theory from Kahneman (1979). Nudge theory from Thaler (2008). Cognitive load theory from Sweller (1988). Bounded rationality from Simon (1955).

All citations formatted in APA 7th Edition. See [Chapter III: Research Foundation](https://sites.google.com/view/jadexzhao/references-html) for the complete list.

## What I Bring

### Agentic AI Systems

Building autonomous agents that process data in real time. Autonomous decision-making within defined boundaries. Continuous adaptation to changing conditions. Human oversight and transparent operations.

LangChain, LLM APIs, RAG Systems, Prompt Engineering

### Human-Centered Design

Systems that maintain human oversight. Transparent decision-making processes. Ethical safeguards and bias detection. Privacy-first data governance following HIPAA and GDPR/CCPA. Technology that enhances rather than replaces human capabilities.

### Technical Skills

SQL, Agentic AI, LangChain, LLM APIs, RAG Systems, Prompt Engineering, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, User Experience Design, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator

### Languages

English and Mandarin (普通话)

### Theoretical Foundations

Cognitive Load Theory, Dual Process Theory, Activity Theory, Nudge Theory, Prospect Theory, Bounded Rationality, Human-Centered AI, AI Ethics

### How I Work

I start with the research. Cognitive load theory tells us how much information people can process. Prospect theory explains how they weigh risks. Nudge theory shows how small design choices shape behavior. I apply these frameworks to bridge human psychology and AI systems, designing agents that enhance rather than replace human capabilities.

In practice, that means building systems with clear boundaries, transparent decision-making, and human oversight built in from the start.

## Projects

Detailed documentation in [Chapter II: Case Studies and Applications](https://sites.google.com/view/jadexzhao/work-html).

Each project includes sample sizes, baselines, how I defined my metrics, and what went wrong or what I couldn't prove.

### Healthcare AI Systems

HIPAA-compliant database systems. Real-time processing of multimodal patient data. Monitoring systems that detect anomalies and route alerts to clinical teams. 30% error reduction, 25-40% workload reduction. Pre/post design, no control group.

### Educational AI Systems

Adaptive tutoring platforms. Ethical safeguards with transparent audit trails and bias detection. Canvas and Blackboard integration. 35% engagement lift (d=0.42), 8-12 hours saved weekly. Historical baseline comparison.

### Nonprofit Technology

Responsive websites with real-time visitor behavior analysis. AI-powered marketing automation for email and social campaigns. 28% bounce rate reduction, 42% engagement increase, 22% conversion lift. Confounded by concurrent redesign.

**Activities:** IU Student Life, Luddy's ServeIT Clinic, FIRST at IU

As Map Coordinator for the Office of Student Life, I support fellow students and help foster a community where everyone feels valued and included. I want to combine my interests in people, technology, and innovation to design experiences that make a positive impact.

**Recognition:**

Hudson & Holland Scholar (full-ride merit scholarship)

Luddy Direct Admit

Luddy Study Abroad and HIEP Grant (international scholarship, January 2026)

I will be studying abroad in Madrid, Spain next semester through Indiana University's program with Universidad Complutense de Madrid. This opportunity means a great deal to me. I received the Luddy Study Abroad Scholarship and the Edward L. Hutton International Experiences Program Grant. I want to immerse myself in a new culture and learn how different communities approach the issues I care about. When I return, I plan to apply what I learn to continue creating user-centered experiences through research and design.

## Looking Ahead

I'm currently building AI agents at Matcha Green Consulting that automate workflows and make decisions in real time. Before that, I worked at the Luddy Center for AI on systems that process live data streams and act autonomously within defined guardrails.

I'm looking for internships, full-time opportunities, or collaborations in AI development, data engineering, or tech consulting for 2026. If you're building agentic AI systems that help people, I'd like to hear about it.

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is structured as a journal because I wanted to document the process, not just the outcomes. Every framework, methodology, and design decision traces back to verifiable sources.

**Why Lunar New Year colors:**

The red and gold palette comes from 春节 (Chinese Lunar New Year). Red for luck, gold for prosperity. This isn't just aesthetic. It's about honoring where you come from while stepping into a new year.

**Key elements:**

Paper texture backgrounds with warm cream tones. Handwritten fonts for dates and margin notes. Journal page styling with binding margins. Research sketches and strategy cards. Red and gold color palette (🧧). Chapter-based organization. Chinese labels on cards (研究笔记, 方法). Gentle animations.

All pages are fully linked with consistent navigation across sections.

## Academic Rigor

This portfolio includes:

**Operationalized metrics:** Sample sizes (N values), time periods, and baseline comparisons for every claim.

**Metrics glossary:** Definitions of how each measurement was taken, including known limitations.

**Explicit limitations:** What I couldn't prove, what confounded the results, why you shouldn't generalize too far.

**Inline citations:** Claims connected to specific papers (Simon 1955, Sweller 1988, Norman 2013, etc.).

**Ethics notes:** IRB status, HIPAA/FERPA compliance, informed consent where applicable.

**Future work:** What the next study should be to address the limitations.

I'm being thorough because it matters. Not just to prove I did the work, but because that's how research should be done.
