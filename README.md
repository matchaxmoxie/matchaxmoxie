## 你好, I'm Jade

**Building AI that serves people, not the other way around.**

First-generation Chinese-American college student and underrepresented in STEM. I grew up in my family's restaurant (364 days a year!) learning 坚持不懈 (perseverance) and the art of serving people well. Didn't see myself in tech until **Girls Who Code** showed me I belonged. Now I build human-centered AI with that same service-first mindset.

**What I do:** AI Strategy • Technical Program Management • Data Engineering
**Fueled by:** 小笼包 • 波霸奶茶 • 好奇心 (curiosity)

---

## The Journey

**饭店 → Tech** • 364 days/year in family restaurant → Girls Who Code → Full ride to IU Bloomington (Luddy Direct Admit, Hudson & Holland Scholar)

**The lesson:** 以人为本 (people-first). Whether serving soup dumplings or serving users, make lives better.

**The passion:** Grant writing • Making tech accessible • Building ethical AI
