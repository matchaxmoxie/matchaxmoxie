# Jade's Journal of AI Research, Strategy & Social Design

**Forensic Documentation of Research-to-Practice Application**

This portfolio is structured as a journal documenting how 38+ foundational research sources inform applied AI development methodologies. Think of it like a journalist's source file - every framework traces back to peer-reviewed research, properly cited and verifiable.

**Why this format?** When exploring opportunities in AI development, data engineering, or technology consulting, credibility matters. This journal provides the foundation that prevents credibility challenges. It's forensic filing - showing exactly where methods come from, not vague "best practices."

**Structure:** The journal is organized into chapters, each accessible through consistent navigation across all pages. All pages are hosted on Google Sites and fully linked together.

## About This Journal

**Jade Zhao 赵 | First-gen Chinese-American | IU Bloomington '27**

Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar. Member of Matcha Green Consulting, an AI strategy consulting startup. Currently exploring opportunities in AI development, data engineering, and technology consulting.

This journal documents how I apply research from Kahneman, Thaler, Simon, Sweller, and 34+ other foundational sources across 5 frameworks I use in practice. Every entry traces back to peer-reviewed work from the 1950s through 2024.

**The Purpose:** I started documenting this because I kept getting asked where my methods come from. After working with 38 foundational sources over two years, I needed to organize this information. Not for presentation, but because transparency matters when building systems people rely on. When someone asks about my methodology, I can reference the research. When someone asks about my approach, I can show the foundation.

## Research Foundation

**38+ peer-reviewed sources • 9 disciplines • 3 Nobel Prize winners • 70+ years of research**

These are the principles I reference when making design decisions. Prospect theory (Kahneman, 1979). Nudge theory (Thaler, 2008). Cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988). Bounded rationality (Simon, 1955).

All citations formatted in APA 7th Edition for verification. See [Chapter III: Research Foundation](https://sites.google.com/view/jadexzhao/references-html) for complete documentation.

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is designed as a journal - forensic documentation of how research becomes practice. Every framework, every methodology, every design decision traces back to verifiable sources. The journal format reflects the systematic approach: documenting the process, not just the outcomes.

**Key Design Elements:**

- Paper texture backgrounds with ruled lines
- Handwritten-style fonts for dates and margin notes
- Journal page styling with binding margins
- Research sketches, strategy cards, and design diagrams
- Consistent green color palette throughout
- Chapter-based organization

All pages are fully linked and accessible. Navigation is consistent across all sections, making it easy to move between chapters and explore the research foundation behind each project.
