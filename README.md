I build digital infrastructure for small teams ... the kind that fits how people actually work. I got my start in STEM and in what you can *grow* with technology, especially when it’s built for real people and small businesses. Being the only girl on an all-boys robotics team didn’t put me off; it strengthened my resolve to build things that matter.

During the pandemic, I worked with local businesses that had no online presence, guiding owners through the full transition: websites, marketing, and automated tools that matched how they already worked ... no manual required.
