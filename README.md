## My Philosophy

***以人为本 (people-first, always)***

User research → Data validation → AI implementation → Impact measurement.

**Theoretical Framework:**

- **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988) - Interfaces designed around working memory limitations
- **Dual Process Theory** (Kahneman, 2011) - Designing for both intuitive and analytical thinking
- **Activity Theory** (Vygotsky, 1978) - Understanding how humans and AI collaborate
- **Diffusion of Innovation Theory** (Rogers, 2003) - Optimizing AI adoption across user segments

Best problem-solving happens over 小笼包 and good conversations.

**Privacy & Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA systems • **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance • **Measurable Impact:** KPI-driven development with continuous A/B testing
