## Background & Journey

My path to technology didn't start in a garage with a computer. It started in my family's restaurant, where I spent 364 days a year learning what it means to serve people well.

As a first-generation Chinese-American college student and underrepresented in STEM, I grew up working alongside my parents in our restaurant. Between taking orders and clearing tables, I learned 坚持不懈 (perseverance), hard work, and the value of putting people first. I couldn't wait to go to college, but during breaks, I was right back at work.

I didn't see myself in technology until **Girls Who Code** showed me I belonged. Suddenly, I realized I could take everything I learned about service and apply it to building technology that helps people.

That realization led me to earn a full-ride scholarship to Indiana University Bloomington (Luddy Direct Admit, Hudson & Holland Scholar). Those restaurant days taught me something crucial: the best service puts people first. Now I apply that same principle to AI and technology.

**Guiding Principle:** 以人为本 (people-first). Whether serving customers or serving users, it's about making lives better.

**Passions:** Grant writing, making technology accessible to everyone, building ethical AI that serves communities
