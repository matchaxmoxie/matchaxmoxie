## My Philosophy

***以人为本 (people-first, always)***

User research → Data validation → AI implementation → Impact measurement.

**Theoretical Framework:**

- **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988) - Grounded in decades of cognitive psychology research on working memory limitations, evolved from Miller's (1956) foundational work on information processing capacity
- **Dual Process Theory** (Kahneman, 2011) - Built on 40+ years of research by Kahneman & Tversky (1974) on heuristics and biases, representing Nobel Prize-winning work (Economics, 2002) on human decision-making
- **Activity Theory** (Vygotsky, 1978) - Rooted in Soviet psychology and cultural-historical activity theory, understanding how humans and AI collaborate through mediated action
- **Diffusion of Innovation Theory** (Rogers, 2003) - Based on 50+ years of research on how innovations spread through social systems, originally applied to agricultural innovations, now fundamental to technology adoption

Best problem-solving happens over 小笼包 and good conversations.

**Privacy & Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA systems • **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance • **Measurable Impact:** KPI-driven development with continuous A/B testing

## Project Relevance & Industry Context (2024-2025)

All projects remain highly relevant in the current AI and enterprise technology landscape:

- **AI Automation & LLM Orchestration**: Applied **Prospect Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and **Bayesian Decision Theory** (Pearl, 1988) to design agentic AI systems. LLM orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenAI API) grounded in probabilistic reasoning and decision-making research.
- **Privacy Compliance Automation**: Applied **Privacy Calculus Theory** (Dinev & Hart, 2006) to balance data utility with privacy protection. Designed systems ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance (European Parliament, 2016) through privacy-by-design architecture.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Grounded in research showing organizations using data-driven approaches show 5-6% higher productivity (Brynjolfsson & McElheran, 2016). Applied **Signal Detection Theory** (Green & Swets, 1966) and **Grounded Theory** (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) for analytics.
- **Technical Program Management**: Applied **Activity Theory** (Vygotsky, 1978) to understand human-AI collaboration and **Ego Depletion Theory** (Baumeister et al., 1998) to manage decision fatigue and optimize team performance.
- **Business Intelligence Platforms**: Applied **Distributed Cognition Theory** (Hutchins, 1995) to understand how humans and technology collaborate in data analysis. Real-time analytics grounded in **Signal Detection Theory** (Green & Swets, 1966) for anomaly detection.

## Testing & Validation Methodology

All projects employ rigorous testing frameworks grounded in peer-reviewed research and industry best practices.

### Usability Testing Methods

- **Think-Aloud Protocols** (Nielsen, 1993) - Users verbalize thoughts while interacting with AI systems to identify cognitive load issues
- **A/B Testing** - Comparative testing grounded in **Dual Process Theory** (Kahneman, 2011) to validate design decisions
- **Heuristic Evaluation** - Expert reviews applying **Fitts's Law** (Fitts, 1954) and **Hick's Law** (Hick, 1952) for interaction optimization
- **Cognitive Walkthrough** - Task-based evaluation assessing mental model alignment (**Mental Model Theory**; Johnson-Laird, 1983)

### Research Validation Methods

- **Signal Detection Theory** (Green & Swets, 1966) - Quantitative validation for automated anomaly detection and classification accuracy
- **Grounded Theory** (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) - Qualitative analysis of user patterns and business trends from observational data
- **Bayesian Validation** - Probabilistic reasoning for model accuracy assessment (**Bayesian Decision Theory**; Pearl, 1988)
- **Cross-Validation** - K-fold validation ensuring generalizability across diverse user segments

### Software Testing Practices

- **Unit Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage for LLM orchestration modules (68% of open-source DL projects lack unit tests; ArXiv, 2024)
- **Integration Testing** - Validating end-to-end workflows across LangChain, OpenAI API, and data pipelines
- **Privacy Testing** - GDPR/CCPA compliance validation using **Privacy Calculus Theory** (Dinev & Hart, 2006) frameworks
- **Research Software Testing** - Specialized methodologies for AI systems addressing unique challenges (ArXiv, 2025)

### User Research Methods

- **Semi-Structured Interviews** - Applying **Grounded Theory** (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to understand user needs
- **Task Analysis** - Decomposing workflows using **Activity Theory** (Vygotsky, 1978) to identify optimization opportunities
- **Surveys & Questionnaires** - Validated instruments measuring system usability (**Technology Acceptance Model**; Davis, 1989)
- **Observational Studies** - Field research applying **Distributed Cognition Theory** (Hutchins, 1995) to understand human-AI collaboration

**Research Foundation:** A 2024 study analyzing 9,129 open-source deep learning projects found that 68% lacked unit tests, highlighting the critical importance of comprehensive testing practices (ArXiv, 2024). Our approach addresses this gap through rigorous validation frameworks.
