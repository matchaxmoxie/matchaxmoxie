I build digital infrastructure for small teams ... websites, marketing, and automation that fit the way people already work instead of forcing them into a mold. My roots are in STEM and in the belief that technology works best when it's built for real people and small businesses, not the other way around. I was the only girl on an all-boys robotics team; instead of backing away, I stayed, learned, and came out of it more determined to build things that matter.

When the pandemic hit, I turned toward local businesses that had no online presence at all. I sat down with owners and walked them through the whole transition ... sites, social and email marketing, scheduling and follow-up tools, and simple automation ... so they could keep their doors open and their customers safe. The goal was never just "get online." It was to make the technology actually work for them, without a stack of manuals or a one-size-fits-all playbook.

### Experience

**Jade🪴 · Freelance**
*May 2020 – Present*

End-to-end digital infrastructure for small businesses: strategy, design, build, and ongoing support. Sites, marketing, and automation that are lightweight and cost-conscious, with a focus on keeping a real personal touch while growing in a way that makes sense for each business.

**Girls Who Code · Web Designer**
*2018 – 2024 · Indianapolis*

Designed and built adaptive websites, automated marketing tools, and contactless solutions ... online menus, QR codes, and checkout flows ... so businesses could stay open and customers could order and pay safely during the pandemic. Worked with teams and learners to put accessibility and equity at the center of what we built.

**Internships**
*UX · Accessibility · Data · Business*

UX Design (Middle Way House) · Digital Accessibility (City of Bloomington) · Data Science (Indiana Phenology) · Business Development (Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce). Proud to have contributed to community-focused work across social services, local government, science, and civic organizations.
