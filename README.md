## My Philosophy

***以人为本 (people-first, always)***

User research → Data validation → AI implementation → Impact measurement. Research shows that human-centered AI development leads to 40% higher user adoption rates and significantly better long-term outcomes.

**Theoretical Framework:**

- **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988) - Interfaces designed around working memory limitations reduce mental effort by 40%
- **Dual Process Theory** (Kahneman, 2011) - Designing for both System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, analytical) thinking
- **Activity Theory** (Vygotsky, 1978) - Understanding how humans and AI collaborate in real-world contexts
- **Diffusion of Innovation Theory** (Rogers, 2003) - Optimizing AI adoption across user segments

Best problem-solving happens over 小笼包 and good conversations.

**Privacy & Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA systems (European Parliament, 2016) • **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (W3C, 2018) • **Measurable Impact:** KPI-driven development with continuous A/B testing

## What I Bring

**Human-Centered AI**

- AI strategy + ethical solutions
- Agentic AI + LLM orchestration
- LangChain • OpenAI • RAG systems
- Privacy-first data governance
- Prompt engineering

**Technical PM**

- Cross-functional coordination
- Stakeholder management
- User-centered roadmaps
- Agile delivery + risk mitigation
- Quality people can feel

**Tech:** `Python` `SQL` `Tableau` `Power BI` `pandas` `numpy` `LangChain` `LLM APIs` `Agentic AI` `Prompt Engineering` `RAG Systems`
**Languages:** English • Mandarin (普通话)
**Theoretical Foundations:** Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) • Dual Process Theory (Kahneman, 2011) • Activity Theory (Vygotsky, 1978) • Nudge Theory (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) • Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) • Bounded Rationality (Simon, 1955)
**Approach:** Cognitive science-informed AI design • Decision science • Behavioral economics
**Work Style:** Usually debugging at a boba shop. Best ideas happen over soup dumplings. (**Ego Depletion Theory** (Baumeister et al., 1998) backs this: breaks restore cognitive resources by 30%.)

## Featured Projects

### Business Technology Strategy & Implementation

Enterprise consulting for AI technology adoption and strategic roadmap development. Applied **Nudge Theory** (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) and **Technology Acceptance Model** (Davis, 1989) to optimize user adoption patterns.

- ✅ **40% reduction** in time-to-market through data-informed prioritization
- ✅ Delivered **3 production-grade AI systems** serving **50,000+ monthly active users**
- ✅ Established GDPR/CCPA compliance frameworks ensuring regulatory adherence

*Industry context: Agile methodologies improve delivery speed by 30-50% while reducing project failure rates by 70% (PMI, 2024). **Ego Depletion Theory** (Baumeister et al., 1998): decision fatigue reduces productivity by 30% - strategic breaks and simplified workflows counter this.*

`Python • LLM APIs • Prompt Engineering • LangChain`

### AI-Driven Business Process Automation

Architected agentic AI system for automated privacy compliance using LLM-based decision engines. Designed using **Prospect Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) to mirror human judgment under uncertainty and **Bayesian Decision Theory** (Pearl, 1988) for probabilistic reasoning.

- ✅ Processed **10,000+ cases** with **99.2% accuracy** achieving **70% cost reduction**
- ✅ **Zero compliance violations** while maintaining GDPR/CCPA compliance
- ✅ Reduced case resolution time from **48 hours to 6 hours** (8x improvement)

*Industry context: McKinsey reports AI automation in compliance reduces costs by 50-70%, with this implementation exceeding benchmarks (McKinsey & Company, 2023). **Bounded Rationality Theory** (Simon, 1955): humans make satisficing decisions under constraints - AI systems accounting for 200+ cognitive biases achieve higher accuracy.*

`Python • LangChain • SQL • OpenAI API • pandas`

### Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Platform

Designed BI platform integrating multi-source data (SQL databases, APIs, ETL pipelines).

- ✅ Real-time executive dashboards used by C-suite for strategic planning
- ✅ Automated anomaly detection reducing incident response time by **65%**
- ✅ Predictive analytics providing **2-week advance indicators** for business trends

*Industry context: Organizations using data-driven decision-making are 5-6% more productive and profitable (Brynjolfsson & McElheran, 2016).*
