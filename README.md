# Jade's Journal of AI Research, Strategy & Social Design

**A Journal of My Programming Journey**

This portfolio is structured as a journal documenting the projects I built and what I learned. It shows how I use basic programming concepts like lists, loops, functions, and user input to build things that work, informed by research I've read about how people use technology.

**Why this format?** I wanted to keep track of my projects and show how I use fundamental programming concepts. This journal shows exactly what I built, how I built it, what programming concepts I used, and the research principles that inform my design decisions.

**Structure:** The journal is organized into chapters, each accessible through consistent navigation across all pages. All pages are hosted on Google Sites and fully linked together.

## About This Journal

**Jade Zhao 赵 | First-gen Chinese-American | IU Bloomington '27**

Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar. Member of Matcha Green Consulting, working on projects with other students. Currently exploring opportunities to keep building and learning.

This journal documents the projects I built using basic programming concepts. Every project uses lists to store data, loops to process information, functions to organize code, and user input/output to interact with people. The approaches I use are informed by research from Kahneman, Thaler, Simon, Sweller, and 34+ other foundational sources about how people interact with technology.

**The Purpose:** I started documenting this because I wanted to keep track of what I learned and the projects I built. After taking c200 and learning about lists, loops, functions, and algorithms, I realized I should organize my work. This journal shows how I use fundamental programming concepts to build things that actually work, and how research principles inform my design decisions. When someone asks about my approach, I can show them both the programming concepts I used and the research behind it.

## Research Foundation

**38+ peer-reviewed sources • 9 disciplines • 3 Nobel Prize winners • 70+ years of research**

These are the principles I reference when making design decisions. Prospect theory (Kahneman, 1979). Nudge theory (Thaler, 2008). Cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988). Bounded rationality (Simon, 1955).

All citations formatted in APA 7th Edition for verification. See [Chapter III: Research Foundation](https://sites.google.com/view/jadexzhao/references-html) for complete documentation.

### KeyNotes

Interactive piano app built because I love playing classical and jazz piano. Started with songs from folklore by TS and simple scales, then expanded to a full 12-key interface. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Web Audio API to play sounds. Features clickable keys, note tracking that stores pressed keys in a list using append, and displays history by looping through the list with event listeners and DOM manipulation. **Tech:** `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `Web Audio API`

### BookWorm

Reading tracker inspired by Goodreads for tracking my own books and reading challenge. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, storing book data in a list and saving with localStorage so it persists when I refresh. Features progress calculation by dividing pages read by total pages, progress bars by looping through the book list, and total books read by counting items in the list. **Tech:** `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `Local Storage`

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is designed as a journal - forensic documentation of how research becomes practice. Every framework, every methodology, every design decision traces back to verifiable sources. The journal format reflects the systematic approach: documenting the process, not just the outcomes.

**Key Design Elements:**

- Paper texture backgrounds with ruled lines
- Handwritten-style fonts for dates and margin notes
- Journal page styling with binding margins
- Research sketches, strategy cards, and design diagrams
- Consistent green color palette throughout
- Chapter-based organization

All pages are fully linked and accessible. Navigation is consistent across all sections, making it easy to move between chapters and explore the research foundation behind each project.
