# Jade's Journal of AI Research, Strategy & Social Design

**Forensic Documentation of Research-to-Practice Application**

This portfolio is structured as a journal documenting how 38+ foundational research sources inform applied AI development methodologies. Think of it like a journalist's source file - every framework traces back to peer-reviewed research, properly cited and verifiable.

**Why this format?** When exploring opportunities in AI development, data engineering, or technology consulting, credibility matters. This journal provides the foundation that prevents credibility challenges. It's forensic filing - showing exactly where methods come from, not vague "best practices."

**Structure:** The journal is organized into chapters, each accessible through consistent navigation across all pages. All pages are hosted on Google Sites and fully linked together.

## About This Journal

**Jade Zhao 赵 | First-gen Chinese-American | IU Bloomington '27**

Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar. Member of Matcha Green Consulting, an AI strategy consulting startup. Currently exploring opportunities in AI development, data engineering, and technology consulting.

This journal documents how I apply research from Kahneman, Thaler, Simon, Sweller, and 34+ other foundational sources across 5 frameworks I use in practice. Every entry traces back to peer-reviewed work from the 1950s through 2024.

**The Purpose:** I started documenting this because I kept getting asked where my methods come from. After working with 38 foundational sources over two years, I needed to organize this information. Not for presentation, but because transparency matters when building systems people rely on. When someone asks about my methodology, I can reference the research. When someone asks about my approach, I can show the foundation.

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is designed as a journal - forensic documentation of how research becomes practice. Every framework, every methodology, every design decision traces back to verifiable sources. The journal format reflects the systematic approach: documenting the process, not just the outcomes.

**Key Design Elements:**

- Paper texture backgrounds with ruled lines
- Handwritten-style fonts for dates and margin notes
- Journal page styling with binding margins
- Research sketches, strategy cards, and design diagrams
- Consistent green color palette throughout
- Chapter-based organization

All pages are fully linked and accessible. Navigation is consistent across all sections, making it easy to move between chapters and explore the research foundation behind each project.
