## 你好, I'm Jade

**Aspiring AI development, data engineering, and technology consulting**

Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar at Indiana University Bloomington, Class of 2027. Studying Informatics (Business, Data, Technology) and specializing in agentic AI, LLM orchestration, and data-driven solutions designed with human needs at the center.

I grew up in my parents' restaurant, practically living there 364 days a year. At the time, I couldn't wait to escape to a "normal" 9-to-5. But those years taught me hard work, perseverance, patience, and the value of showing up. Looking back, I see how profoundly that shaped who I am and how I approach every challenge.

- **What I do:** Aspiring AI development, data engineering, and technology consulting
- **Approach:** Research-driven methodology • Human-centered design • Measurable business outcomes
- **Currently Exploring:** Opportunities in AI development, data engineering, and technology consulting

## Background

- **Path:** Family restaurant operations → Girls Who Code (Python, web dev) → Hudson & Holland Scholar (full-ride) → IU Luddy Direct Admit
- **Context:** First-generation Chinese-American college student. Girls Who Code alumni. Part of underrepresented groups in STEM, bringing diverse perspectives to AI development.
- **Focus:** User-centered design • Privacy-compliant systems (GDPR/CCPA) • Measurable business impact
