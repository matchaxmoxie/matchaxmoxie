I put down roots in STEM and in what you can actually *grow* with tech .. especially when it’s built for real people and small teams. Being the only girl on an all-boys team didn’t push me away; it pulled me deeper into the soil. That, plus my school’s CS club, set how I tend things now: **accessibility, equity, and first-generation students at the center.**

During the pandemic I worked with small businesses that had zero online presence .. guiding owners through the whole transition: websites, marketing, and automated tools that fit how they already worked, not the other way around. Built everything from sites and marketing to scheduling, follow-ups, and paperwork so they could focus on their customers and their craft. The goal wasn’t just “get online” .. it was **make the tech work for them.**
