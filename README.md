I build digital infrastructure for small teams. Websites, marketing, automation ... things that fit how people already work instead of forcing them into a mold.

I was the only girl on an all-boys robotics team. I stayed, learned, and left more determined to build things that matter. When the pandemic hit, I turned toward local businesses with no online presence. I sat down with owners and walked them through the whole transition: sites, social and email marketing, scheduling, follow-up tools, simple automation. The goal was never "get online." It was to make the tech actually work for them ... no manuals, no one-size-fits-all playbook.
