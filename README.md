# Jade's Journal of AI Research, Strategy & Social Design

**A Journal of My Programming Journey**

This portfolio is structured as a journal documenting the projects I built and what I learned. It shows how I use basic programming concepts like lists, loops, functions, and user input to build things that work, informed by research I've read about how people use technology.

**Why this format?** I wanted to keep track of my projects and show how I use fundamental programming concepts. This journal shows exactly what I built, how I built it, what programming concepts I used, and the research principles that inform my design decisions.

**Structure:** The journal is organized into chapters, each accessible through consistent navigation across all pages. All pages are hosted on Google Sites and fully linked together.

## About This Journal

**Jade Zhao 赵 | First-gen Chinese-American | IU Bloomington '27**

Luddy Direct Admit and Hudson & Holland Scholar. Member of Matcha Green Consulting, working on projects with other students. Currently exploring opportunities to keep building and learning.

This journal documents the projects I built using basic programming concepts. Every project uses lists (arrays) to store data, loops (for/while) to process information, functions (procedures) to organize code, and user input/output to interact with people. The approaches I use are informed by research from Kahneman, Thaler, Simon, Sweller, and 34+ other foundational sources about how people interact with technology.

**The Purpose:** I started documenting this because I wanted to keep track of what I learned and the projects I built. After learning about lists, loops, functions, and algorithms, I realized I should organize my work. This journal shows how I use fundamental programming concepts (lists to store data, loops to process it, functions to organize code, and user input/output to make programs interactive) to build things that actually work. The research principles inform how I structure these basic concepts. When someone asks about my approach, I can show them both the programming concepts I used (lists, loops, functions, user input) and the research behind why I structured the code that way.

## Projects & Code

See [Chapter II: Case Studies &amp; Applications](https://sites.google.com/view/jadexzhao/work-html) for detailed documentation.

### Running the Projects

All Python projects can be run directly from the command line:

```bash
# Run KeyNotes - Interactive Piano App
python keynotes.py

# Run BookWorm - Reading Tracker
python bookworm.py
```

Both projects demonstrate fundamental programming concepts:

- **Lists (Arrays)**: Store data structures (piano keys, books)
- **Loops (Iteration)**: Process data and iterate through collections
- **Functions (Procedures)**: Organize code into reusable blocks
- **User Input/Output**: Make programs interactive

**AI strategy consulting startup** specializing in consumer and customer industry solutions. Building human-centered AI solutions with privacy-first architectures. Working with cross-functional teams and implementing GDPR/CCPA compliant systems. **Focus:** AI strategy • Digital marketing automation • Full-stack development

### KeyNotes

Interactive piano app built because I love playing classical and jazz piano. Started with songs from folklore by TS and simple scales, then expanded to a full 12-key interface. Built as a Python command-line application that uses lists (arrays) to store piano keys with their note names and frequencies, loops (iteration) to search through keys and process user input, and functions (procedures) to organize code for playing notes and tracking history. Features note tracking that stores pressed keys in a list using append, and displays history by looping through the list. Uses user input/output to make it interactive through keyboard input. **Tech:** `Python` `Lists` `Loops` `Functions` `User Input/Output`

### BookWorm

Reading tracker inspired by Goodreads for tracking my own books and reading challenge. Built as a Python command-line application that uses lists (arrays) to store book data with reading progress, loops (iteration) to process and display books, and functions (procedures) to organize code for calculating progress and managing the reading list. Features progress calculation by dividing pages read by total pages using division operations, progress bars generated by looping through the book list, and total books read by counting items in the list. Uses user input/output to add and update books interactively. **Tech:** `Python` `Lists` `Loops` `Functions` `User Input/Output`

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio is designed as a journal - forensic documentation of how research becomes practice. Every framework, every methodology, every design decision traces back to verifiable sources. The journal format reflects the systematic approach: documenting the process, not just the outcomes. Every project uses the same building blocks: lists (arrays) to store data, loops (iteration) to process it, functions (procedures) to organize code, and user input/output to make programs interactive. The research informs how these basic concepts are structured to create programs that work well for people.

**Key Design Elements:**

- Paper texture backgrounds with ruled lines
- Handwritten-style fonts for dates and margin notes
- Journal page styling with binding margins
- Research sketches, strategy cards, and design diagrams
- Consistent green color palette throughout
- Chapter-based organization

All pages are fully linked and accessible. Navigation is consistent across all sections, making it easy to move between chapters and explore the research foundation behind each project.
